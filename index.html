    <h1>Favourite Things I've read</h1>
    <h3>Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid</h3>
    <p>I spent this summer working at a community pool where I had lots of time to read. My favourite book I read was "Malibu Rising" by Taylor Jenkins Reid</p>
    <p>This book follows four famous siblings who throw the most epic party every year. It follows them through a 24 hour time period before, during, and after the party. They are trying to navigate relationships, loss, and the secrets they have among each other. I am one of four siblings too so I liked reading about the dynamics between the four of them.</p>
    <p>I would recommend this book to someone who wants a fun, light, summer read that will keep you on your toes</p>
